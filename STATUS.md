# venice-cpp — status (for the next session)

A session-local snapshot of where the project is and what's next. Supplements
AGENTS.md (which holds standing conventions, not state).

## Where we are

**Phase 0: DONE and verified against the live API.**
- `chat()` non-streaming completion (verified: "venice-cpp works").
- `chat_stream()` SSE streaming via callback, cancellable (verified live).
- `models()` list (104 models fetched), `balance()` rate-limit endpoint.
- `venice_parameters` extension with forward-compatible `extra` passthrough.
- Error model: `std::expected<T, Error>`, kinds network/http/parse/auth/
  rate_limited/invalid_arg, each carrying status + raw body.
- Header-only INTERFACE lib; cpp-httplib + nlohmann/json (header-only) +
  OpenSSL (link-time). KDE/Qt-ready shape (UI-free, Qt-linkable).

## Next up
1. **AIForge chat-TUI MVP** — see issue #1. Composes venice-cpp + termforge.
   This is the agreed next move; both foundations are proven.
2. Thicken endpoints as AIForge/KDE need them (image/audio/video, TTS,
   embeddings, characters, retries/backoff, async). Driven by real use, not
   speculatively.
3. KDE integration (later leg) — a D-Bus/Qt service layer on top of this
   client (KRunner plugin first). Qt types stay OUT of this library.

## Cross-project context
- Stack: cpp-template (base) -> venice-cpp (API) + termforge (TUI) -> AIForge.
- venice-cpp issues double as the AIForge kickoff tracker for now (#1).

## How to verify
gcc 14 + clang 20. Offline unit tests (Catch2). Live smoke needs $VENICE_API_KEY.
Watch the cpp-httplib API version quirks (Request has body+set_header, no
set_content/content_type_; send(req,res,err) returns bool).
